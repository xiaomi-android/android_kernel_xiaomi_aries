RMI4 Touchscreen Driver
=======================

TBD

Firmware Update Function
========================

The RMI4 driver uses the kernel's request_firmware() feature to obtain
firmware for the touch sensor.  The firmware is expected to live in
the file firmware/rmi4/<productid>.img, where <productid> is the Product ID
found in the F01 query registers (F01_RMI_QUERY11 through F01_RMI_QUERY20).

To prepare Synaptics provided .img file for reflashing, convert it to .ihex
format using the following command:

    objcopy -I binary -O ihex <productid>.img firmware/rmi4/<productid>.img.ihex

Then make sure to add the image file name to the CONFIG_RMI4_FWLIB entry in
firmware/Makefile.  If you don't do this, the image file won't be included, and
the firmware loader class will delay for 60 seconds waiting for a non-existent
userspace response to the firmware load request.

Firmware updates for multichip solutions (aka LTS) are not supported.
